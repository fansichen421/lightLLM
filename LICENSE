0. PREAMBLE
The human-readable summary (the "Deed") and the full license (the "Legal Code") are not
the license itself — they are just helpful references for casual users. The license
itself is the Legal Code below.

1. Definitions
a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is
derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material
is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner
requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor.
For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work,
performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the
Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.

b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights
in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions
of this Public License.

c. BY-SA, BY, CC, and other abbreviations are used in the Deed for the license
short-hand; in the Legal Code the full license name and terms are used.

d. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related
to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording,
and moral rights, in any medium or format whether now known or later developed and
whether or not subject to Copyright and Similar Rights.

e. Effective Technological Measure means those measures that, in the absence of
proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under
Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and similar
international agreements.

f. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other
excuse or defense to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the
Licensed Material.

g. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material
to which the Licensor applied this Public License.

h. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions
of this Public License, which typically include reproduction, adaptation, public
display, performance, distribution, and communication of the Licensed Material,
but exclude moral rights as recognized by the licensor's jurisdiction, and rights
that are not within the scope of Copyright and Similar Rights.

i. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) that offer(s) the Licensed Material
under the terms of this Public License.

j. NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards commercial
advantage or monetary compensation.

k. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that
circumvents technological protection measures or by distribution.

l. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from
sui generis database protection as provided under applicable law.

m. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public
License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

2. Scope
a. License grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the
Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable,
non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed
Material to:
   i. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and
   ii. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

b. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and
Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do
not need to comply with its terms and conditions.

c. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6.

d. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes
You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known
or later created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You
from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights,
including those necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures, except
where such circumvention is prohibited by law.

e. Downstream recipients. The license granted by Licensor extends to all recipients
of the Licensed Material and Adapted Material.

3. License Conditions
Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following
conditions.

a. Attribution. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form),
You must:
   i. retain the following if supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:
      A. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others
         designated to receive attribution, in a reasonable manner requested by
         the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);
      B. the title of the Licensed Material if supplied;
      C. to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
         specifies to be associated with the Licensed Material;
   ii. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and provide a reasonably
       thorough description of the modifications;
   iii. indicate the license of the Licensed Material (Creative Commons
        Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International) and include a link to
        the license;
   iv. include the notice that the Licensed Material is licensed under this
       Public License, and any required copyright and license notice(s) (unless
       such notices are not supplied by the Licensor).

b. NonCommercial. You may not exercise any of the Licensed Rights for commercial
purposes. For the avoidance of doubt, examples of commercial purposes may include,
but are not limited to, charging a fee for access, distributing as part of a
product or service sold for a fee, or otherwise seeking to generate a direct
commercial advantage. Whether a particular use qualifies as NonCommercial depends
on the specific circumstances and may require legal analysis.

c. No additional restrictions. You may not apply legal terms or technological
measures that legally restrict others from doing anything the license permits.

4. Sui Generis Database Rights
Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to the
Licensed Material, the Licensor grants You the rights to extract, reutilize,
and Share all or a substantial part of the contents of the database provided the
use is NonCommercial, subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License.

5. Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability
a. Disclaimer. THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS AND MAKES NO
   REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL,
   EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
   WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
   OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF
   IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

b. Limitation of Liability. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT
   WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
   INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
   THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE
   LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

6. Termination
a. This Public License and the rights granted hereunder terminate automatically
   upon any breach of the terms by You. However, where an infringement of the
   Licensed Material is curable, the Licensor may elect to provide a cure period
   prior to termination.

b. Sections that by their nature survive termination shall survive termination.

7. Other Terms and Conditions
a. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be
   construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of
   the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted
   official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution.

b. Representation and warranties by Licensor. The Licensor represents and
   warrants that they have the rights necessary to apply this license to the
   Licensed Material.

c. Jurisdiction. Where any legal action arises out of or relates to this Public
   License, the Licensor and You agree to attempt to mediate in good faith prior
   to bringing litigation.

d. Miscellaneous. This Public License constitutes the entire agreement between
   the parties with respect to the Licensed Material and supersedes all prior
   understandings regarding such subject matter.
